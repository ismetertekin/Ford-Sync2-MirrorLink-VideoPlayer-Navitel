# SYNC2-MirrorLink
This way we can start Mirrorlink with EasyCon once we have it installed in Ford Sync2, through the packs. Tested on Samsung S9+ Android 10 version.

I also put ideas on how I can use android auto with the EasyCon application doing Mirrorlink, although it is only used to have the platform, because the app that manages the connection is still EasyCon.

This app is only compatible with Android for this process in Sync2, and some versions such as Huawei are not being compatible, among some other brands, such as ZTE, some low-end references from Xiaomi, One, many brands and references really work and occasionally some they do not work.

Mirrorlink works through an app called easycon, it is installed on your phone and radio from special programming. It only works with Android phones, it's not a CarAuto, it's just achieving screen mirroring ability via easyeasycon.

The screen must be on all the time to broadcast, it is connected by USB cable, and there are variations depending on the versions of Android. for Android 10 or higher, the touch screen cannot be operated from the radio, it must be done from the cell phone, for Android 9 or lower, yes.

YouTube, waze and other browsers work and almost all mobile applications, beware, Netflix and others like Disney will not work, they do not allow streaming, there is also a method to watch Netflix through an app that virtualizes the process, I shared Jimmy Gomez, thanks friend, and although I haven't tried it yet it worked for him, so I'll try it.
